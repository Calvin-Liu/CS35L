You want to run
od -An -f -N 4000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > random.txt

Doing this will create a file with 4 million bytes of random numbers. od is 
used to format the read in file and piping it to tr removes the white spaces 
and creates new lines to put each number on their own line. 

You also want to remove the first line which is an enmpty line
Then you want to time each thread, and run a certain number of threads

use the time command to time the process
--parallel to run a number of threads
the -p is an option for time and the -g is an option for sort
run that on the random file of 4 million bytes

Run:
For 1 thread:
time -p sort -g --parallel=1 random.txt > /dev/null

real 8.40
user 8.34
sys 0.03

For 2 threads:
time -p sort -g --parallel=2 random.txt > /dev/null

real 4.90
user 9.16
sys 0.02

For 4 threads:
time -p sort -g --parallel=4 random.txt > /dev/null

real 3.16
user 10.04
sys 0.04

For 8 threads:
time -p sort -g --parallel=8 random.txt > /dev/null

real 2.06
user 10.54
sys 0.05

The user+sys time can be more than the real time because we are running
mutliple threads on the program
