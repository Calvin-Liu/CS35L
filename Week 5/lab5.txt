1)wget the coreutils zip package
2)go into the folder 
3)./configure CFLAGS="-g"
4)then you want to compile the file by hitting make
5)get the patch online
6)patch -p0 < patch to apply the patch of the link and rebuild it
7)I checked to reproduce the bug by going in src and then doing checking the
./ls

8)

$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
$ cd $tmp
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
$ touch now
$ sleep 1
$ touch now1
$ TZ=UTC0 ~/Desktop/CS35L/Week5/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time
wwi-armistice now now1

$ cd
$ rm -fr $tmp

Note -lt sorts it by time so the first file should be at the bottom of the list

If you run the system then you will see the right version of the ls program
appear

9)$ gdb --args ./ls â€“lt /tmp/wwi-armistice /tmp/now tmp/now

Need to look at the function called sort_files
Put a breakpoint at this point and run it with arguments 
Pay attention to qsort
Follow the functions down until you hit the most basic implementation of the
function which is the timespec_cmp.
There are multiple functions that create a tree like path until you hit the
most basic.

Q1) Building the file as is without the patch created an error where the make
did not work and produced an error. The make did not work because the futimens
function has been changed to coreutils_futimens because a header line included
the defition for futimens already 

Go into the timespec.h file in lib and go to the timespec_cmp function, you
will notice that the subtraction creates an overflow with the 64bit data which
overflows from a huge postitive to a huge negative number. To change that you
would fiddle around with a comparison function instead to obtain the return
values of -1,1, or 0. Using a subtraction or even addition could lead to an
overlow in byte representation. 
To test the implementation:

Create a diff file that is also your log file. The diff file should include
the implementation to the timespec.h file. 

TZ=UTC0 ~/Desktop/CS35L/Week5/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time
wwi-armistice now now1
To test with the following other commands given above.

Seasnet does not properly handle the case. This is because it is switching
from a 64bit machine to a 32 bit machine and 32 bits are getting truncated
meaning the sign bit is lost. Since 1918 is before the epoch time, it is
stored as a negative number but when truncated it is a positive number. To fix
the problem you had to make a change to the ls file.
