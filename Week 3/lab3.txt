Q1) It would not matter because the goto line was removed and there is another
case statement above it that can waterfall through to the line below it.

Q2)This patch would pose a problem to those that do not use the traditional
three field time style. If you want something different then the specific
style has to be specified and if it was a different language then it wouldn't
work because it is set a specific locale. Another case would be if the file is
a year old then it would display the year instead of the time.
